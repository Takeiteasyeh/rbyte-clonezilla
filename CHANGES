# v2.0 - February 29, 2020
###################

+ We now have a changelog!
+ Nvme drives are now default copy targets.
+ Primary ATA device is now default target (when nvme is missing).
+ We now look for a ntfs partition on a usb device to determine default source disk.
+ We now allow cloning to different size disks!!
+ Added more options when more than one source is detected.
+ Added an extra option on confirmation to choose a different action.
+ Added an extra options when more than one target is available.
+ Introduced the ignoring of usb devices with no ntfs partitions
+ We can now reverse clone from the internal drive to an external for load creations.
+ Added a menu for handling all the extra actions.

* Version updated to 2.0 due to the major rewrite of base code.
* USB device now defaults to source, even if label is missing.
* Rewrote the diskinfo parsing and moved logic outside this call.
* Massive code cleanup
* We now ignore optical drives.
* Improved the detail output during the scan phase to better help technicians.

! We only support finding ntfs based default sources. This MAY be fixed but isn't high on the list.

? Code can use alot of cleanup now that I know more what I'm doing...
